# MCFT
This is a MATLAB implementation of the Multi-resolution Common Fate Transform. The MCFT of an audio signal outputs a four-dimensional representation capturing the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of the signal. MCFT increases the separability of audio mixtures composed of sources with significant tieme-frequency overlap and different modulation patterns.

## MATLAB Code Dependencies
The MCFT toolbox uses [the CQT implementation](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/CQT/) by Sch√∂rkhuber et al. to compute the time-frequency representation of the input audio signal.
