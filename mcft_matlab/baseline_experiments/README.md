### baseline_representations:
Contains the implementation of two baseline methods, the STFT and the CFT, and the corresponding inverse transforms.

### clusterability:
Contains the code for computing the normalized cut loss for audio mixtures represented in the STFT, CQT, CFT, and MCFT domains.

### separability:
Contains the code for computing the BSS-Eval measures for audio sources that are separated through ideal binary masking of mixtures represented in the STFT, CQT, CFT, and MCFT domains.
