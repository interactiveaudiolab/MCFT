# MCFT
This toolbox provides MATLAB and Python implementations of the Multi-resolution Common Fate Transform. The MCFT of an audio signal outputs a four-dimensional representation capturing the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of the signal. 

MCFT [increases the separability](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/assets/papers/pishdadian_pardo_mcft_journal_2018.pdf) of audio mixtures composed of sources with significant time-frequency overlap and different modulation patterns (e.g. two voices singing in unison, each having differernt vibratto). This allows effective source separation for audio scenes where approaches that work on time-frequency representations (e.g. magnitude spectrograms) fail. 

## MATLAB Code Dependencies
The MCFT toolbox uses [the CQT implementation](http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/CQT/) by Sch√∂rkhuber et al. to compute the time-frequency representation of the input audio signal. 

## Demos
Audio examples, time-frequency plots, and detailed experimental results are provided in [the demo webpage](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/MCFT).
