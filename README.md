# MCFT
This toolbox is a MATLAB implementation of the Multi-resolution Common Fate Transform. The MCFT of an audio signal outputs a four-dimensional representation capturing the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of the signal. MCFT increases the separability of audio mixtures that are composed of sources with significant tiem-frequency overlap but different modulation patterns.
