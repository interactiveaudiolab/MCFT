# MCFT
This is a Python implementation of the Multi-resolution Common Fate Transform. The MCFT of an audio signal outputs a four-dimensional representation capturing the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of the signal. MCFT increases the separability of audio mixtures composed of sources with significant tieme-frequency overlap and different modulation patterns.
